          <li><strong>Event information:</strong> event date, venue, guest count, services requested and related notes.</li>
          <li><strong>Payment details:</strong> when you pay through a third-party gateway we may receive transaction confirmations; we do not store full card numbers on our servers.</li>
          <li><strong>Technical data:</strong> IP address, browser type, device type, pages visited and analytics data.</li>
          <li><strong>Other data:</strong> anything you voluntarily submit (messages, attachments, photos related to your event).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use information to:</p>

          <li>Payment processors or platforms you choose to pay through.</li>
          <li>Authorities when required by law (court order, legal process) or to protect rights and safety.</li>

        <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data. However, no system is 100% secure — absolute security cannot be guaranteed for information transmitted over the internet.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain personal data only as long as needed for the purposes described or as required by law. When no longer required, we will delete or anonymize your data.</p>
